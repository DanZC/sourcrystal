# Pokémon Sour Crystal

This is a improvement hack of Pokémon Crystal that tries its best to remain in the style and feeling of Gen2, while also giving the player more
options and quality of life tweaks to improve their gameplay experience.

This hack includes the following:

# Major Changes
- New animated Pokemon sprites.
- A new Challenge Mode that provides a slightly steeper level curve and small tweaks to Trainer/Gym leader parties, similar to the same mode from B2W2.
- All routes from HGSS are included.
- A fully functioning Safari Zone with a completley new map.
- Upgraded Swarm System that is triggered via Oaks Talk Show on the radio. Can spawn 1 swarm per day and the swarming pokemon has a boosted chance of being shiny (1%).
- Upgraded Trainer Rematch System that allows you to re-battle available trainers as many times as you want within their schedule.
- Trainer Rematch parties now grow depending on your game progression, instead of the amount of remtaches.
- Updated base stats, moves and items from the later generations.
- Reusable TMs.
- All 252 pokemon obtainable.
- A new Pager system to remove the need for HM Slaves. The HMs themeselves remain and their moves can be overwritten at any time.
- Fully re-scaled Kanto Region, based on its size from gen1.
- Inluded more Kanto Maps. Viridan Forest, Cerulean Cave, Seafoam Islands, and...???
- Trade evolutions work as before, but can also evolve by simply "using" their items on them as an option. In addition, Haunter/Graveler/Machoke/Kadabra can also evolve using a new item, the "Linking Cord".
- Evolution stones and items can now also be purchased at the game corner for coins.
- The Odd Egg now has a 50% chance of being Shiny.


# Minor Changes
- Instant Apricorn Balls from Kurt.
- More frequently available apricorns throughout the region.
- Apricorns and Berry trees now visibly show their fruit on the overworld and respawn every nite at 12am.
- All Pokeballs have unique palettes, and have their intended functions restored, except for the Fast Ball which now functions as it did in GenIV+.
- Wild pokemon can no longer Flee. (Except the Legenday Beasts and in the Safari Zone).
- A new Time of Day. EVENING, which functions like the Day and is only a visual change. Consequently, NITE will now start at 8pm instead of 6pm.
- New attack animations and colors for multiple moves.
- Unique party icons for each Pokemon.


# This hack DOES NOT have... 

-The physical/special split, however it makes changes to the category of 3 types. Ghost is now special and Dark and Dragon 
are now Physical. This will allow the majority of said types to use their stab a bit more effectivley and make using these mons' more worhwhile for the player.

-Running Shoes.
-60 Fps.
-Any post gen2 mons'.
-Following Pokemon (for now?)
-Any Story changes
